# nlp-emoji

## Summary

In this project, I seek to find the added value (if any) of emoji in typical document classification models. Several models were evaluated with logisitic regression ultimately being selected for having the best F1 score. Data was collected from the CrowdFlower "Data for Everyone" [online library](http://www.crowdflower.com/data-for-everyone). Using emoji as features in a logistic regression classifier model did not result in a significant increase in F1 score, though other, more emoji-rich text might demonstrate the added value of emoji in classification models.
